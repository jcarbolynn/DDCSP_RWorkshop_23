## DDCSP R Coding Workshop (2023)

Instructors: Briana Betke, Joelle Carbonell and Kate Jones

Date: TBD

Location: Online via Zoom/Discord


## Purpose

This workshop is intended to teach r basics and some visualization with spatial data. There will be preworkshop materials to review before the workshop to ensure that R and Rstudio are properly installed. Please see *insert link for the resources here* for the preworkshop materials. There will be open office hours on Zoom at *TBD* for any questions regarding set up and R coding. For the workshop, we will teach a primer on spatial data! We will cover the types of spatial data and how to visualize spatial data.

## Coding Requirements

There are no expectations of knowing R before viewing the preworkshop materials. This is intended for beginners with a little something that everyone can learn. We will start off with base R for the majority of the workshop with an additional package or two. It will be required that you have a device that is capable of running R studio. This is typically a challenge for Chromebooks, you may need to set up a container or consider using R Studio Cloud. Please let the instructors know if this is a problem and we can try to assist.
